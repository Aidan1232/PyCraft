# PyCraft

PyCraft is a modular sandbox experience built in Python, crafted for legacy resilience and emotional resonance. Using the Ursina engine, it reimagines voxel gameplay through a config-driven lens where every block placed, shader toggled, and entity spawned becomes part of a symbolic ritual. It’s not just about building worlds—it’s about architecting meaning.

This game does use discord rich presence in the code!
